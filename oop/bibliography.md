# bibliography
 
Most of the notebooks were adapted from Luciano Ramalho's classes on OOP (with his permission).
The material was in general very inspired by his book Fluent Python which I really recommend to anyone that wants to take their - Python knowledge one step further (or many, depending on how much time you dedicate to the book).
